# Qiz 
Powered by cutting-edge AI, Qiz adapts to your learning style, ensuring that you grasp every topic with ease and confidence.

## Inspiration 💫
We found inspiration for our project by asking fellow students what they wished they had in their education journey. These students wished they had a tool they could use to learn and help them battle procrastination. A research shows **87% of college students report that their education is a significant source of stress**. That way, we hope our platform, Qiz, can start helping them. 

## What it does  💻 
Qiz is an **AI-powered web app** for students to create practice tests from their notes or even from simply searching a topic. What sets Qiz apart from others is the feature that allows students to upload their exam schedules and a study plan will be generated for them. 

## How we built it 🐱‍💻🐱‍💻🐱‍💻
1. **Front-end:** ReactJS, Bootstrap
2.  **Back-end:** Gemini API, Python

## Challenges we ran into 🙈
As we progressed into the project, challenges that arose included merge conflicts as well as installing the right dependencies. Another challenge we faced was formating the prompt from Gemini to obtain the output we wanted. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🌟
We were able to build an application that uplifts the education of students by addressing the inaccessibility of educational resources. Being students ourselves, we value the importance of equity and it was one of the main factors we focused on in our project. As a team, we are proud of the collaboration that we had, which enabled us to persevere against any issue that we encountered.

## What we learned 🏫
Throughout this project, we learned how to implement technology that was rather new to us such as Gemini and Python. We explored the Gemini protocol designed for delivering content promptly to our users. Moreover, implementing Gemini allowed us to understand its streamlined approach to web browsing, emphasizing privacy and simplicity. Although Python was not entirely new to us, this project required us to utilize it in more advanced and complex ways.

## What's next for Qiz 💻📝
* Provide features for educators such as curating quizzes or exams.
* Implement a leaderboard to build a community among students and we plan to utilize an SQL database to store user progress.
* Finding suitable pre-trained models and fine-tuning them to provide accurate and precise results for students by implementing AI/ Machine Learning.
